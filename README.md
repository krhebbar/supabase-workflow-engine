## 🎯 Overview

This project showcases a sophisticated workflow automation engine built entirely on PostgreSQL/Supabase. It demonstrates how to build complex, event-driven systems using database triggers, scheduled functions, and state machines—all while maintaining type safety and production-grade reliability.

**Perfect for showcasing:**
- Advanced database architecture and design
- Event-driven system design
- Workflow orchestration patterns
- PL/pgSQL and SQL expertise
- Production-ready error handling and retry logic

## ✨ Features

- **🔄 Database-Driven Workflows**: Execute multi-step workflows using PostgreSQL triggers and functions
- **⏰ Scheduled Task Execution**: Cron-based job processing with customizable schedules
- **🔁 Retry Logic**: Built-in exponential backoff for failed workflow actions
- **🔐 Secrets Management**: Integration with Supabase Vault for secure credential storage
- **📊 Workflow State Tracking**: Complete audit trail of workflow execution
- **⚡ Event-Driven Architecture**: Database triggers for real-time workflow activation
- **🎯 Type-Safe Client**: Full TypeScript support with auto-generated types

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Database-First Design

Unlike traditional job queue systems (Bull, BullMQ, etc.), this engine leverages PostgreSQL's native capabilities:

- **No external dependencies** - Everything runs in your database
- **ACID guarantees** - Workflow state changes are transactional
- **Single source of truth** - No synchronization issues between DB and queue
- **Simplified deployment** - No additional infrastructure to maintain

### Workflow Execution Model

```
┌─────────────────┐
│  Database Event │
│   (INSERT/UPDATE)│
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Trigger Fires  │
│  Creates Log    │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Cron Function  │
│  Polls Pending  │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  HTTP Callback  │
│  To Application │
└────────┬────────┘

│  Handle Retry   │
└─────────────────┘
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Supabase CLI
- PostgreSQL 15+ (or Supabase project)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/supabase-workflow-engine.git
cd supabase-workflow-engine

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Supabase credentials

# Run migrations
npx supabase db reset
```

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { WorkflowClient } from './src/client';

// Initialize client
const client = new WorkflowClient({
  supabaseUrl: process.env.SUPABASE_URL!,
  supabaseKey: process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
});

// Create a workflow
const workflow = await client.createWorkflow({
  name: 'user-onboarding',
  trigger: 'user_created',
  actions: [
    {
      type: 'send_email',
      payload: { template: 'welcome' },
      delay_minutes: 0,
    },
    {
      type: 'create_tasks',
      payload: { taskList: 'onboarding' },
      delay_minutes: 60,
    },
  ],
});

// Workflow automatically executes when trigger event occurs
```

## 📚 Core Concepts

### Workflows

A workflow defines a series of actions to be executed in response to a trigger event. Each workflow can have multiple actions that run sequentially or in parallel.

### Workflow Actions

Individual steps within a workflow. Actions can:
- Call external HTTP endpoints
- Execute database procedures
- Send notifications
- Wait for specified durations
- Branch based on conditions

### Workflow Action Logs

Track the execution state of each action:
- `not_started` - Scheduled but not yet executed
- `processing` - Currently executing
- `completed` - Successfully finished
- `failed` - Execution failed (will retry)

### Retry Mechanism

Failed actions automatically retry with exponential backoff:
- Initial retry: 1 minute
- Second retry: 5 minutes
- Third retry: 15 minutes
- Maximum retries: 5 (configurable)

## 🎓 Examples

### Example 1: Email Workflow

Send a series of onboarding emails to new users:

```typescript
// See examples/email-workflow/README.md
```

### Example 2: Scheduled Task Processing

Process background jobs at specific intervals:

```typescript
// See examples/scheduled-tasks/README.md
```

### Example 3: Event-Driven Automation

Trigger workflows based on database changes:

```typescript
// See examples/event-triggers/README.md
```
